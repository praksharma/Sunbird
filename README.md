My manuals for Sunbird HPC cluster.

Follow "[Introduction to High Performance Computing for Supercomputing Wales: Introduction to Supercomputing Wales](https://edbennett.github.io/SCW-tutorial/)" to get the basic understanding of HPC clusters.

[Ed Bennett](https://github.com/edbennett?tab=repositories), [Supercomputing Wales](https://github.com/orgs/SupercomputingWales/repositories) and [Swansea Academy of Advanced Computing](https://github.com/sa2c) has got lots of useful tools and tutorials.


The Sunbird's [user guide](https://github.com/praksharma/Sunbird/blob/main/Supercomputing-Wales-User-Guide-User-Guide-2020-v1.pdf) contains details to do almost everything, but it poorly written for beginners. Commands are incomplete i.e. not reproducible and lacks a workflow.
