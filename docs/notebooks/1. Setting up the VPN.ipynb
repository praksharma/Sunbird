    "# Setting up the VPN\n",
    "Swansea University has got VPN to securely access the university's local network. Firstly, we need to setup the VPN using the instructions given over [here](https://vpn.swansea.ac.uk/).\n",

    "To start with, we need to download the [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) on a mobile phone for extra security using [MFA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory-mfa-multi-factor-authentication).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting up the VPN software\n",
    "Now we need to download a supported VPN client. Pulse Secure is a supported VPN client. For Windows and MAc systems, follow the instructions over [here](https://connect.swan.ac.uk/) to download the VPN client.\n",

    "\n",
    "For Arch system, download the AUR version over [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pulse-secure). I generally use Paru to download packages from AUR. Follow [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwvQUtv1eM0&t=572s) to setup Paru. Paru is preinstalled in [ALG](https://archlinuxgui.in/).\n",
